To make sure all of these ideas are organized in your mind, please go through the list of problems below. 
For each, identify which supervised learning method(s) would be best for addressing that particular problem.

1.) Predict the running times of prospective Olympic sprinters using data from the last 20 Olympics.

    I would use a linear regression to model the prospective Olympic sprinters.  The data from the last 20 Olympics would be able to
    provide data and variables that can help make a linear model. 
    
2.) You have more features (columns) than rows in your dataset.

    For a dataset where I have more features than rows in my dataset I would use a lasso regression model.  A Lasso regression model
    helps prevent overfitting which can occur in a dataset with many features and it inherently has an embedded feature selection to 
    reduce the number of features.
    
3.) Identify the most important characteristic predicting likelihood of being jailed before age 20.

    I would use a linear regression.  The most important characteristic predicting the likelihood of being jailed before 20 would
    show in the variable that accounts for the highest variance in the data.  

4.) Implement a filter to “highlight” emails that might be important to the recipient

    I would use a Naive Bayes filter.  Naive Bayes is simple and it does well with simple classification.

5.) You have 1000+ features.

    For a dataset where I have a lot of features in my dataset, I would use a lasso regression model.  A Lasso regression model
    helps prevent overfitting which can occur in a dataset with many features and it inherently has an embedded feature selection to 
    reduce the number of features.    

6.) Predict whether someone who adds items to their cart on a website will purchase the items.

    For this problem, I would use a decision tree or a random forest.  I believe that a decision tree would be able to model the 
    decisions that would lead a person to purchase items on the site.  To help get a better accuracy predicting the purchase items,
    I would use many decisions trees implement a random forest model. 

7.) Your dataset dimensions are 982400 x 500

    For a dataset where I have 500 features in my dataset, I would use a lasso regression model.  A Lasso regression model
    helps prevent overfitting which can occur in a dataset with many features and it inherently has an embedded feature selection to 
    reduce the number of features.

8.) Identify faces in an image.

    I would use a Gradient boosting model.  I believe that the iterative process of the gradient boosting model would help the model
    identify faces in an image.

9.) Predict which of three flavors of ice cream will be most popular with boys vs girls.

    I believe the best model for this problem would be a support vector machine.  Data from boys and girls would be sectioned off
    into decision boundaries on where their preferences lie for ice cream.
