1.) Let's say we work at a credit card company and we're trying to figure out if people are going to pay their bills on time. 
    We have everyone's purchases, split into four main categories: groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment. 
    What are some ways you might use KNN to create this model? What aspects of KNN would be useful? 

    We can implement a KNN model by taking two of the features and use that as the dimensions to see if a person will pay
    their bill on time.  For example, we can use amount spent on groceries and dining out as the dimensions that will be
    used to model a KNN classifier to determine if a person will pay their bill on time.  It is possible to change up the 
    dimensions too.  We can choose amount spent on utilities and entertainment as the dimensions for the KNN classifier.  
    One aspect of the KNN that would be very helpful is being able to visualize the decision bounds on whether a person
    will pay their bill on time.
